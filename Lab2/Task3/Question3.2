How does your implementation react to broken checkpoint files? Try overwriting a
checkpoint.timestamp.dat with random data and see how your program behaves. Can
you come up with ways to check if the data restored from a checkpoint file is internally
consistent? Can you think of a way to check if a checkpoint has been corrupted, even if the
resulting state may still be internally consistent?

If the file is broken the previous state can't be restored. The data stored in the files are based on a common layout therefore it is possible to check if the input of the file is internally consistent. You can also search for invalid values in the file.
