Your program should produce exactly the same output after checkpoint restoration as during the initial run. What information does a checkpoint of your worker need to contain for this purpose? Are any changes to the worker required? Justify your answers!

We need the allnumbers variable which contains all generated numbers, because we need to write them to the file as only the worker knows them and they will be lost if he crashes. We dont need the input parameters because they are stored in the monitor process.
