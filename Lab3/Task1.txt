Question 1.1:
The topics of the two papers are the Fault Injection-tools GRINDER and PAIN. They can be used to
evaluate the robustness (i.e. the ability to cope with external faults) of components of a software.
 GRINDER is a generalist tool that is intended to be highly reusable for different kinds of software and
to be independent from the software under test. PAIN is not a generalist tool, it exploits parallel hardware to execute multiple FI experiments
at a time. By that PAIN achieves a tradeoff  between increased throughput and accuracy, as it assumes non-
interference among the simultaniousely executed experiments.

Question 1.2:
GRINDER is a generalist Fault Injection-tool that, contrary to most other FI-tools, is highly reusable. 
Therefore the big advantage of it is that it is intended to be applicable to any software with a low cost of
applying it to the software.

Question 1.3:
The purpose of the PAIN experiments is to investigate the tradeoff between increased throughput and accuracy.
It is investigated wether the throughput is higher in a parallel environment, wether the results are dependent
of the increase in that environment and wether the increase leads to an increase in heterogenity among repeated injection campaigns.

Question 1.4:
The throughput is higher in the parallel case but the results are dependent of that increase,
the results are dependent of the increase and an increase of heterogenity among repeated injection campaigns is observed.
It is noted that a correct setup/tuning of parallel experiments may prove difficult and requires special care. A very important observation is
that there are cases when parallelism can change the results even after repetitions.
Therefore the conclusion is that the parallel execution of FI experiments can improve the throughput, but can also affect the accuracy of results. Hence,
careful tuning of the degree of parallelism is required to avoid negative effects on accuracy.
